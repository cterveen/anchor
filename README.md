# anchor

A project for drupal 7 which collects named anchors from a book and makes an index of them.

You can add index items by making a anchor with the name "indexKeyword" in your book-page and check the index with <domain>/book/index/<nodeid>. The index of the node and it's subpages will be shown.

You can use a specific keyword only once even in different nodes, keywords may contain spaces.
